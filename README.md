# FocusGuard_Application
Students often get distracted by YouTube, games, and social media while studying on laptops/PCs. This application boosts productivity by blocking time-wasting apps and sites. It also uses AI (Gemini) to suggest better study habits, helping students stay focused, manage time, and improve learning efficiency.
